Topic: Challenges in addressing the invisibility of care work performed by women in Brazil

According to demographic studies conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the elderly population will increase drastically in the coming decades. In this context, the care work performed by women is essential to support this segment of the population. However, invisibility and state neglect are challenges that perpetuate the disregard faced by these workers in Brazil. Therefore, urgent measures must be taken to resolve this widespread emergency.

From this perspective, it is crucial to overcome the lack of debate surrounding the importance of care activities. On this matter, the renowned philosopher Djamila Ribeiro argues that, in order to act on a situation, it must first be made visible. Nevertheless, the national scenario contrasts with the author's reasoning, as the high number of domestic workers in precarious working conditions goes unnoticed by society, which hinders prioritization of discussions around this issue and makes interventions more difficult. Thus, this obscurity must be brought to light to raise awareness in society.

Furthermore, it is worth highlighting how the negligence of the state fosters the marginalization of caregivers. In this regard, Polish sociologist Zygmunt Bauman uses the term "Zombie Institution" to symbolize entities that no longer fulfill their intended roles. Following this logic, the Executive Branch can be seen as an example of Bauman’s concept, since its duty to ensure professional dignity for all is not being fully met — as many care workers still find themselves in undignified conditions. Therefore, governmental conduct must be restructured to safeguard the rights of these professionals.

Thus, it becomes essential to mitigate the marginalization of care work carried out by women. To this end, the Ministry of Citizenship, as the body responsible for social policies, must promote data and research that reveal the severity of the neglect faced by caregivers, using prominent media platforms to reach as many people as possible and raise awareness. In addition, society, through the Public Prosecutor's Office, must demand effective occupational protection measures from the Federal Government for domestic workers, with the aim of ensuring dignified labor for these individuals. In doing so, the next generation of elderly individuals may be adequately supported.
