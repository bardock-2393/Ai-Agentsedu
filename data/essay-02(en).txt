Topic: Invisibility and civil registration: ensuring access to citizenship in Brazil

Norberto Bobbio, an Italian political scientist, states that democracy is a process whose core goal is to guarantee political representation for all individuals. For the democratic mechanism to function, it is essential to have a state network that ensures access to various resources such as food, housing, education, security, healthcare, and electoral participation. However, many Brazilians, due to lacking a birth certificate, are deprived of these basic rights and have their roles as citizens rendered invisible. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the historical roots of this problem and its harmful consequences.

Firstly, it becomes evident that the social erasure caused by the lack of civil registration finds its origins in the past. According to the sociologist Karl Marx, inequalities stem from economic conditions that precede each individual’s birth, meaning that, unfortunately, not everyone is granted the same financial and social opportunities throughout life. From this perspective, Marx’s historical materialism is relevant to analyze the plight of those living without a birth certificate in Brazil, as they likely belong to family lineages that also lacked access to registration. Thus, social inequality continues to be perpetuated, affecting groups that have already been deeply impacted by the country’s colonial and patriarchal roots. Therefore, it is essential that the government break this cycle, which excludes, above all, the poor, women, Indigenous peoples, and Black Brazilians.

In addition, this unjust process creates deep wounds in Brazil’s democracy. In the novel Vidas Secas by Graciliano Ramos, the story of a backlands family struggling to survive without state support is portrayed. In this context, the characters Fabiano and Sinhá Vitória have two sons who do not have birth certificates. Due to this irregular registration situation, the boys do not even have names, which is unthinkable in modern society, since a person’s name is a fundamental part of their identity. Moreover, the children depicted in the novel resemble many others in Brazil who are unable to benefit from childhood and youth public policies due to the lack of documentation — a reality that must be urgently changed so that a truly participatory democracy, as envisioned by Bobbio, can be established.

Therefore, civil registration must be more effectively promoted in the country. The State shall launch a nationwide campaign entitled “My Registration, My Identity.” This project will be carried out through collaboration among social movements, local communities, and municipal, state, and federal government agencies, since collective action is required to strengthen Brazilian citizenship. With the efforts of these agents, professionals will be sent to every city to locate individuals who will finally receive their birth certificates and will also be offered guidance and encouragement to register for other important national services. Consequently, Brazil will be taking active steps to correct its historical injustices and solidify its democracy so that all citizens may be equally recognized.
