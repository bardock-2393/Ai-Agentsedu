Topic: The Stigma Associated with Mental Illness in Brazilian Society

In the American film *Joker*, the main character, Arthur Fleck, suffers from a mental disorder that causes him to have uncontrollable, excessive laughter in public — a condition for which he is frequently attacked on the streets. Arthur’s reality mirrors that of many citizens, as the stigma associated with mental illness in Brazilian society remains a challenge that must be addressed. This situation persists due to both government neglect and the discrimination faced by this group from segments of the population. Thus, it is imperative that this social wound be resolved so that the North American film no longer reflects the current reality of the nation.

From this perspective, regarding the logic surrounding mental disorders, it is important to revisit the previously mentioned aspect of state omission in this context. According to the WHO (World Health Organization), Brazil has the highest number of depression cases in Latin America, and even in the face of this alarming scenario, mental health treatments — when available — are often ineffective. This is due to the lack of public investment in specialized mental health care centers. As a result, many individuals, especially those with lower incomes, do not receive proper treatment, which contributes to their ongoing marginalization in society. This scenario of government inaction exemplifies sociologist Zygmunt Bauman’s theory of Zombie Institutions, which exist within society but fail to fulfill their intended roles effectively. Therefore, in order to disprove the Polish scholar’s theory, this issue must be resolved.

Alongside governmental neglect, it is also crucial to discuss civil prejudice against individuals with mental illnesses, as both factors are barriers to their full inclusion. This prejudice arises from the flawed societal ideals of happiness that are presented as universal goals. These conceptions divide people into "strong" and "weak" — with the so-called “weak” often including those affected by mental illness, since they are perceived as unable to achieve such standards (such as emotional stability). Consequently, those who fail to meet these expectations are stigmatized and excluded from the social fabric. This segregating structure — targeting individuals with some form of mental disorder — urgently needs to be dismantled so that the principles of German philosopher Hannah Arendt (implicitly referenced here) may be validated in Brazilian society.

Therefore, active measures are essential to reverse the stigma associated with mental illness in Brazilian society. To this end, the Ministry of Health must invest in improving the quality of treatment offered at public mental health centers by increasing the supply of medication and hiring more professionals, such as psychiatrists and nurses, through competitive public exams. This should be financed with funds authorized by the Federal Court of Accounts, the body responsible for overseeing public expenditures, in order to enhance care and ensure effective treatment for these patients. Additionally, public talks should be organized in shared spaces to highlight the dangers of false ideals of happiness and the importance of embracing the vulnerable. In doing so, unattainable ideals will cease to be tools of exclusion, and Fleck’s reality will no longer reflect that of Brazilians.
