### Competency 3: SELECT, RELATE, ORGANIZE, AND INTERPRET INFORMATION, FACTS, OPINIONS, AND ARGUMENTS IN DEFENSE OF A POINT OF VIEW

The third aspect evaluated is how you, in your essay, select, relate, organize, and interpret information, facts, opinions, and arguments in defense of the chosen point of view. You must clearly present the idea you are defending and support it with appropriate arguments related to the prompt's theme.

Competency 3 focuses on the **intelligibility** of your text — in other words, its coherence and logical flow, which stem from proper **pre-writing planning**, also known as text structuring.

Your essay’s intelligibility depends on the following:

- Selection of arguments;
- Logical connections between the parts of the text;
- Smooth progression that reveals the essay was carefully planned, with ideas gradually and coherently introduced;
- Development of arguments, clearly demonstrating their relevance in supporting your point of view.

**WHAT IS A TEXT PLAN?**

A text plan is the pre-writing structure of your essay — the strategic organization of arguments. It defines which arguments will support your viewpoint and the best order to present them, ensuring that the final text is clear, cohesive, and persuasive. An essay that meets Competency 3 expectations reveals an implicit plan and a clear strategy for defending a point of view.

**WHAT IS DEVELOPMENT?**

Development refers to how you justify your arguments throughout the essay. It includes explaining and deepening the facts and opinions you present. Good development may involve examples, definitions, comparisons, analogies, statistics, etc. Regardless of the method, all content must be clearly connected to the point of view you're defending. Unrelated or weakly developed information makes the argument harder to follow.

Since the number of lines is limited, it is essential to carefully select the most effective arguments and fully elaborate on them to avoid gaps in reasoning that the reader would need to fill in.

**Tips to meet the expectations of Competency 3:**

- Define your point of view based on the proposed theme;
- Brainstorm all relevant ideas, then select and organize those that best support your viewpoint;
- Check if the selected information, facts, and opinions genuinely support your thesis;
- Arrange ideas logically, so the reader can follow your reasoning — ensure your essay flows and is coherent with your initial text plan;
- Carefully revise your introduction and conclusion to ensure consistency between the beginning and end;
- Make sure your arguments support the point of view and are thoroughly developed, without leaving interpretative gaps;
- Avoid adding facts and opinions that are not properly explained or connected to the rest of the essay.

**In short, when organizing your argumentative essay, you should:**

- Clearly state your point of view and select arguments that support it;
- Ensure logical sequencing of ideas so that each paragraph follows smoothly from the previous one — avoid redundancy and abrupt topic shifts;
- Develop arguments through explanation, clarification, or exemplification of facts and opinions to convince the reader of your thesis.

**Evaluation rubric:**

- **200 points:** Presents information, facts, and opinions relevant to the topic in a consistent, organized manner that reflects authorship and supports a clear point of view.
- **160 points:** Presents relevant and organized content with signs of authorship in support of a point of view.
- **120 points:** Presents content limited to ideas from the prompt texts and with little organization, in support of a point of view.
- **80 points:** Presents relevant content but in a disorganized or contradictory way, relying heavily on the prompt texts, with minimal support for the point of view.
- **40 points:** Presents little relevant or incoherent content with no clear defense of a point of view.
- **0 points:** Presents irrelevant or disconnected content with no defense of a point of view.
