### Competency 2: UNDERSTAND THE ESSAY PROMPT AND APPLY KNOWLEDGE FROM VARIOUS FIELDS TO DEVELOP THE TOPIC WITHIN THE STRUCTURAL LIMITS OF A DISCURSIVE-ARGUMENTATIVE ESSAY

The second aspect evaluated in your essay is your understanding of the prompt, which requires you to write a discursive-argumentative text — that is, a piece in which you defend a point of view through reasoning and argumentation.

It is more than a simple exposition of ideas; therefore, you must avoid writing an expository-only essay. You are expected to clearly take a stance. Moreover, your point of view must directly relate to the topic specified in the prompt. Competency 2 assesses your integrated reading and writing skills.

The topic is the core idea around which your argument is built and is a narrower cut of a broader subject. You must stay within the defined thematic scope to avoid **tangential treatment** (partial coverage) or, worse, developing a different topic altogether.

Another important element is the use of **sociocultural references** — that is, facts, citations, or lived experiences that enrich your argumentation and support your perspective.

To fully meet the expectations of Competency 2, follow these recommendations:

- Read the prompt and supporting texts carefully to fully understand what is being asked;
- Reflect on the topic to define your focus: how you’ll approach it, what your viewpoint is, and how you will defend it;
- Do not copy from the prompt texts. Excessive copying is penalized and may result in a lower score or even disqualification;
- Avoid restricting yourself to the ideas presented in the prompt texts. You may reference them, but your essay should go beyond and draw on external knowledge (sociocultural repertoire);
- Use relevant information from your own knowledge — from areas such as literature, history, science, etc. — and integrate it meaningfully into your text to support your argument. Loose quotes or facts that are not connected to your thesis weaken your argument;
- Stay focused on the theme. Avoid diverging from the central topic, which is a common issue. Two types of deviation may occur: **complete off-topic** or **tangential** treatment.

**WHAT IS COMPLETE DEVIATION FROM THE TOPIC?**

This occurs when the essay does not address either the broad subject or the specific topic of the prompt.

For example, in ENEM 2022, the theme was about challenges in valuing traditional communities/peoples. Essays that received a zero in this competency typically:

- Never mentioned traditional communities or any related idea;
- Mentioned only “communities” or “peoples” (without “traditional”) but not their valuation challenges;
- Used the terms without addressing the specific issue of “valuation” or “respect.”

**WHAT IS TANGENTIAL TREATMENT?**

This occurs when the essay addresses only the broader subject, but not the specific topic or focus required by the prompt.

In ENEM 2022, an essay was considered tangential if it:
- Talked about traditional peoples/communities but did not mention the **challenges** of valuing them;
- Used generic terms like “communities” or “peoples” without specifying “traditional,” even if the valuation challenge was mentioned.

**WHAT IS A DISCURSIVE-ARGUMENTATIVE TEXT?**

It is a text organized around the defense of a point of view on a given subject. It uses argumentation to influence the reader’s opinion and to convince them that the idea being presented is valid.

It combines:
- **Argumentative elements** (defending a position),
- **Explanatory elements** (explaining ideas clearly and logically).

The goal is to persuade the reader using coherent reasoning supported by facts, opinions, and references.

**Use the following evaluation table:**

- **200 points:** Develops the topic with consistent argumentation, based on productive sociocultural references, and demonstrates excellent command of the discursive-argumentative essay structure.
- **160 points:** Develops the topic with consistent argumentation and shows good command of the essay structure (thesis, argument, and conclusion).
- **120 points:** Develops the topic with predictable argumentation and average command of the essay structure.
- **80 points:** Relies on copying from prompt texts or shows insufficient command of the discursive-argumentative structure, lacking clear thesis, argument, and conclusion.
- **40 points:** Touches only on the general subject (tangential treatment), or demonstrates weak understanding of the discursive-argumentative genre with traces of other genres.
- **0 points:** Complete deviation from the topic and/or failure to follow the discursive-argumentative structure. These essays receive a zero and are disqualified.
