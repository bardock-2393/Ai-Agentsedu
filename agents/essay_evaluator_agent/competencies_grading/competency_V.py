### Competency 5: DEVELOP A PROPOSAL FOR INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS THE DISCUSSED PROBLEM WHILE RESPECTING HUMAN RIGHTS

The fifth aspect to be evaluated in your essay is the presentation of a **proposal for intervention** that addresses the problem discussed in the prompt, while **respecting human rights**. Proposing an intervention means suggesting an initiative aimed at confronting the issue.

The ENEM writing task is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your readiness to engage in citizenship and contribute to social change in alignment with human rights. Therefore, beyond taking a critical stance and supporting a point of view with arguments, you must indicate an initiative that could effectively intervene in the problem discussed.

The intervention proposal must:
- Be **related to the theme**,
- Be **integrated into the text’s argumentation structure**,
- Be **coherent** with the thesis and arguments already presented (as evaluated in Competency 3).

It should clearly address the problem(s) raised in your essay and be well articulated with your overall writing project.

A strong intervention should be **concrete**, **specific to the theme**, and **consistent** with your development. Ideally, you should identify:
- The **action** (what will be done),
- The **responsible agent** (who will do it),
- The **means of implementation** (how it will be done),
- The **intended effect** or outcome,
- Any **additional relevant detail**.

**Students should aim to answer the following when developing their proposal:**

1. What solution can be proposed to the problem?
2. Who is responsible for executing it?
3. How can the solution be implemented?
4. What effect or result is expected?
5. What other detail can be added to enrich the proposal?

**WHAT IS CONSIDERED A VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS?**

The ENEM essay has always emphasized the importance of respecting human rights. According to the official rubric, essays that include proposals violating these principles will be penalized under Competency 5.

Examples of violations include, but are not limited to:
- Defending torture, mutilation, or summary execution,
- Supporting vigilante justice (“taking justice into one's own hands”),
- Inciting violence based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, political views, physical condition, geographic origin, or socioeconomic status,
- Expressing hate speech against specific social groups.

The following **human rights principles**, based on Article 3 of Resolution No. 1 (May 30, 2012), which outlines Brazil’s National Guidelines for Human Rights Education, should be upheld:

- Human dignity  
- Equality of rights  
- Recognition and appreciation of diversity  
- Secularism of the state  
- Democracy in education  
- Inclusivity and comprehensiveness  
- Socio-environmental sustainability
