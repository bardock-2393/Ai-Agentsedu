### Competency 4: DEMONSTRATE KNOWLEDGE OF LINGUISTIC MECHANISMS NECESSARY FOR BUILDING ARGUMENTATION

This competency evaluates the logical and formal structuring between parts of the essay. Textual organization requires that sentences and paragraphs establish relationships that ensure coherent sequencing and interdependence of ideas.

This articulation is achieved through **cohesive devices**, especially **argumentative operators**, which are the main elements responsible for semantic connections throughout a discursive-argumentative essay. Examples include relations of:
- similarity (e.g., “similarly”, “likewise”),
- contrast (e.g., “however”, “nevertheless”),
- cause/consequence (e.g., “therefore”, “as a result”),
- conclusion (e.g., “in conclusion”, “thus”).

Prepositions, conjunctions, adverbs, and adverbial phrases contribute to textual cohesion by connecting clauses, sentences, and paragraphs. Pronouns and referential expressions also play a key role — as we’ll explore below under **referencing**.

In your writing, you should use a variety of linguistic resources to ensure **continuity of ideas**, making your text cohesive. Competency 4 assesses the mechanisms that provide textual flow and connection.

> Competencies 3 and 4 both assess the construction of argumentation, but focus on different levels:
- Competency 3 evaluates deep structure — the logic and coherence of ideas.
- Competency 4 evaluates surface structure — the linguistic markers that help readers interpret your ideas clearly.

You must show knowledge of the cohesive mechanisms needed to properly link paragraphs and sentences.

**HOW TO ENSURE TEXTUAL COHESION?**

Cohesion should be observed at different structural levels:

- **Paragraph structuring**: A paragraph is a unit centered on one main idea supported by secondary ones. In discursive-argumentative texts, paragraphs may develop through comparison, cause-effect, exemplification, or elaboration. There should be clear and explicit links between paragraphs.

- **Sentence structuring**: Given the argumentative nature of this essay type, sentences tend to be complex — containing two or more clauses — to express cause/consequence, contrast, chronology, comparison, and conclusion.

- **Referencing**: As your essay progresses, people, places, facts, or ideas should be clearly introduced and then referred to again. This can be done using:
  - pronouns,
  - adverbs,
  - articles,
  - synonyms,
  - antonyms,
  - hypernyms/hyponyms,
  - summary expressions,
  - metaphors or metadiscursive phrases.

---

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

To create cohesive links, use the following strategies:

a) **Referential substitution**: Replace earlier terms using personal, demonstrative, or possessive pronouns, location-indicating adverbs, or articles.

b) **Lexical substitution**: Replace terms with synonyms, hypernyms/hyponyms, or summarizing expressions.

c) **Verbal substitution**: Use connectives or expressions to reference previously mentioned verbs, nouns, phrases, or full clauses.

d) **Ellipsis**: Omit elements already mentioned or easily inferred from context.

- Use **argumentative operators** to link clauses, sentences, and paragraphs fluidly.
- Always check whether the cohesive element you've used conveys the intended meaning.

---

**In summary, avoid the following when writing:**

- Lack of connection between clauses, sentences, or paragraphs;
- No paragraph breaks (writing everything in a single paragraph);
- Use of a connector (e.g., preposition, conjunction, relative pronoun, adverb) that does not establish a logical link and impairs comprehension;
- Inappropriate repetition or substitution of words without using proper linguistic tools (e.g., pronouns, adverbs, synonyms).

**Evaluation rubric:**

- **200 points:** Effectively connects all parts of the text and demonstrates a wide range of cohesive devices.
- **160 points:** Connects parts of the text with minor issues and uses a varied set of cohesive resources.
- **120 points:** Connects parts of the text in an average way, with some errors and limited use of cohesive devices.
- **80 points:** Connects parts of the text insufficiently, with many errors and a narrow range of cohesive tools.
- **40 points:** Poor articulation of ideas throughout the text.
- **0 points:** No cohesion; ideas are disconnected.
