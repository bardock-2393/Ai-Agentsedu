### Competency 1: DEMONSTRATE COMMAND OF THE FORMAL WRITTEN REGISTER OF THE PORTUGUESE LANGUAGE

Competency 1 assesses whether the student demonstrates mastery of the formal written register of the Portuguese language. This includes knowledge of writing conventions such as spelling and accentuation rules governed by the current Orthographic Agreement. Additionally, command of the formal register is evaluated through the grammatical correctness and syntactic construction of the text.

To clarify expectations for a high school graduate regarding formal writing skills, below are the key elements considered by evaluators when determining the performance level for Competency 1.

First, it’s important to understand that formal written language is the expected register for argumentative-essay texts. This is clearly stated in the writing prompt: “Based on the reading of the supporting texts and your accumulated knowledge, write a discursive-argumentative text in formal written Portuguese on the topic…”. Thus, your writing will be assessed for syntactic structure and the presence of deviations (related to writing conventions, grammar, register, and word choice).

Syntactic structure is assessed along with deviations, as it is part of language rules—those that govern sentence construction. A conventional syntactic structure includes specific sentence elements that organize ideas fluently and clearly in well-structured and complete periods. As ENEM essays require complex formal writing, top-scoring texts typically feature subordinate and embedded clauses.

Texts with structural issues often display truncated periods, word juxtaposition, missing elements, or excessive elements. For instance, a full stop dividing what should be one sentence (truncation), or a comma used where a full stop should mark the end of a sentence (juxtaposition), both negatively impact syntactic structure. The frequency and severity of these issues determine the score assigned.

Pay attention to the following types of deviations:

- **Writing Conventions**: accentuation, spelling, hyphen usage, capitalization, and syllabic division (hyphenation);
- **Grammatical**: verb and noun agreement, use of verb tenses and moods, punctuation, syntactic parallelism, pronoun usage, and use of the grave accent (`crase`);
- **Register Choice**: adherence to the formal written register, i.e., avoiding informal language and spoken discourse features;
- **Vocabulary Choice**: use of precise vocabulary, meaning words must be used correctly and appropriately for the context.

**Use the following scoring table:**

- **200 points:** Demonstrates excellent command of formal written Portuguese and appropriate register. Grammatical or writing convention errors are rare and do not recur.
- **160 points:** Demonstrates good command of the formal written register, with a few grammatical and writing convention deviations.
- **120 points:** Demonstrates average command of the formal written register, with some grammatical and convention deviations.
- **80 points:** Demonstrates insufficient command of the formal written register, with many grammatical, register, and convention deviations.
- **40 points:** Demonstrates poor command of the formal written register, with frequent and varied grammatical, register, and convention deviations.
- **0 points:** Demonstrates a lack of knowledge of the formal written register of Portuguese.
